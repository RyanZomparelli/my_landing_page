            I grew up as the oldest of four siblings in North Carolina. While I
            currently live in Baltimore, MD, I drive home to visit every
            holliday season.

            I first began climbing at Pilot Mt NC as a teenager and have been
            climbing on and off ever since. Throughout the last few years I've
            had the opportunity to climb at Red River Gorge KY, New River Gorge
            WV, Seneca Rocks WV, Safe Harbor PA, Red Rocks NV, and throughout
            Puerto Rico.

            Growing up in North Carolina, I've always loved hiking. Living in
            Maryland, I often miss the rugged mountinous trails that weave
            around the cliffs and valleys of western NC.

            When I moved to Baltimore I loved riding my bike around the city. I
            had always worked in construction, but when I found out there were
            couriers in Baltimore I had to try it, so I became a bike messenger;
            zipping around town for lawyers, doctors, and real estate agents
            with time sensitive and sometimes confidential documents.
